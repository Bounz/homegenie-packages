# YouLess Energy Monitor

The YouLess Energy monitor is a Dutch product that measures current energy usage by detecting the turns of the rotor disc or LED-pulses of an electricity meter. More info (in Dutch) can be found 
<a href="http://www.youless.nl/" target="_blank">here</a>.

It has the following output Parameters:
- Meter.Total - Current total on the meter
- Meter.Watts - Current electricity usage in Watts

## Setup

- IP Address
- Port number
- UpdateInterval

No Username/Password support, but it shouldn't be a difficult addition.

According to <a href="http://www.homegenie.it/forum/index.php?topic=129.msg7141#msg7141" target="_blank">this post</a> in the forum the widget uses a lot of resources. I cannot test this anymore as I no longer have a YouLess device.
